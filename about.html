                        <p>Founded in 1962, America's Blood Centers is the national organization bringing together community-based, independent blood centers.</p>

                        <p>Our member organizations operate more than 600 blood collection sites providing close to 60 percent of the U.S., and a quarter of the Canadian, blood supply. These blood centers serve more than 150 million people and provide blood products and services to more than 3,500 hospitals and healthcare facilities across North America. All ABC U.S. members are licensed and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>

                    <p>We provide representation and advocacy on behalf of our member blood centers, ensuring their voices are heard in the development of national health policy and before decisionmakers in federal agencies and the U.S. Congress. ABC also provides its members with a wide variety of resources and programs, including scientific, medical, technical, quality, and regulatory expertise. Additionally, members receive access to education and networking workshops, publications, sharing of best practices; and benchmarking reports. ABC has been recognized by the U.S. Congress for our critical work in patient care and disaster preparedness and response.</p>
